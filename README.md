# SteamAchievement

This is the code for SAM, originally released in 2019, last major release in 2011, and last updated in 2017 (a hotfix).

The code is being made available so that those interested can do as they like with it.

There are some changes to the code since the last closed-source release:
- General code maintenance to bring it into a more modern state.
- Icons have been replaced with ones from the Fugue Icons set.
- Version has been bumped to 7.0.x.x to indicate the open-source release.
